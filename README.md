# A Chaste User Project for inputing specific parameters from CSV into a Chaste simulation at command line
More will be added here soon for how to run this. 

Testing requirements:
- [x] Working Base Test
- [x] Functionality for test to interact with command line inputs
    
Writer outputs from Chaste that are necessary:
- [] Polygon Number
- [] Area Ratios
- [] Cell perimeter
- [x] Edge length
- [] Cell elongation
- [] Area deviation
- [] Area correlation
- [] Polygon number correlation
- [] Neighbour Areas
- [] Neighbour numbers
- [] Laser recoil (Needs determining)
- [] Area asymetry
- [] Perimeter asymetry
