# A Chaste User Project for inputing specific parameters from CSV into a Chaste simulation at command line
More will be added here soon for how to run this. 

Testing requirements:
- [x] Working Base Test
- [x] Functionality for test to interact with command line inputs
    
Writer outputs from Chaste that are necessary:
- [x] Polygon Number - Usable version from Ecad ADD
- [] Area Ratios
- [x] Cell perimeter - ADD
- [x] Edge length
- [x] Cell elongation
- [] Area deviation
- [x] Area correlation (Outputs may need varificaiton as initialy produces nans)
- [] Polygon number correlation
- [x] Neighbour Areas
- [x] Neighbour numbers
- [x] Neighbour numbers correlation

Need looking at further
- [] Laser recoil
- [] Area asymetry
- [] Perimeter asymetry
