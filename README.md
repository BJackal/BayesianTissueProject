# A Chaste User Project for inputing specific parameters from CSV into a Chaste simulation at command line
More will be added here soon for how to run this. 

**Testing requirements**
- [x] Working Base Test
- [x] Functionality for test to interact with command line inputs
    
**Writer outputs from Chaste that are necessary**

- [x] Polygon Number - Usable version from Ecad ADD
- [x] Area Ratios - No explicit writer. Can be performed through combination of the polygon and Area writers.
- [x] Cell perimeter - ADD
- [x] Edge length
- [x] Cell elongation
- [x] Area deviation
- [x] Area correlation (Outputs may need varificaiton as initialy produces nans)
- [ ] Polygon number correlation - Making from Ecad writer
- [x] Neighbour Areas
- [x] Neighbour numbers
- [x] Neighbour numbers correlation

Need looking at further
- [ ] Laser recoil
- [ ] Area asymetry
- [ ] Perimeter asymetry
